# Welcome: Intro to Programming - DATA-GBG-E24C - 1


This is an introductory course in programming with Java at KÃ¸benhavns Erhvervsakademi KEA. The course is for students with no or little prior experience with programming.


*Learning objective:* In this class, students will learn about the key building blocks used for writing code in Java. We will cover the basics of solving problems with code.


*Learning outcome:* Students will become knowledgeable about basic methods, object-oriented programming and algorithms and data structure.

#### Aniko Zsigri

Aniko is from Hungary. She has a candidate in electronics engineering. She has worked several years in DTU as a research assistant. After DTU she has worked as a software developer approximately 10 years, where she has mostly worked with c# programmering language. The last 10 years Aniko was teaching in a HTX gymnasium programming, Technology, Technology, Mathematics and Physics subjects. In the gymnasium she teached python and made robots with the help of Arduino.
